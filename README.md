# ANN and Chemical Potential

In this project, I developed artificial neural network (ANN) potentials for density functional theory (DFT) and designed innovative algorithms for chemical potential calculations.


This project allowed me to combine my passion for data science with my interest in materials science, leading to the development of groundbreaking ANN potentials and innovative chemical potential algorithms
